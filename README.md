# Elon B-Gon

This is a Chrome extention will remove any Elon Musk related content.
It will also replace text relating to him with jokes.

## On the Roadmap

1. [ ] Replace Elon Musk with a random Elon Musk quote

    - [ ] so "Elon files for bankruptcy over twitter crash" becomes something like "'There's definitely water here look around you' files for bankruptcy over twitter crash"

2. [ ] The extension will read reddit threads that are images for captions / translations for blind redditors, if one cannot be found look for the words in reddit's post body/comments.

3. [ ] Replace brute force regex search with a benchmarked search algorithm made for text replacement (gh copilot thinks tries might be a good option)

### Name Choice

play on word of 'be gone' and N-gon
